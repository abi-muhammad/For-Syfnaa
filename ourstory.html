        Dear, Syfna <br>
    Hi, I just want to say thank you. Thank you for being an incredible woman who makes my life brighter, for listening to me, and for always being there during times that aren’t always easy. Honestly, having you in my life makes me feel calmer and no longer alone, unlike before when I felt lonely.I hope we can always stay together. I hope you’re always doing well, and I also hope we can meet in person someday because I want to tell you so many things. If you’re feeling tired or if something is on your mind, don’t hesitate to talk to me. You don’t have to be strong all the time. I’m happy to be here with you.Sometimes I think about how small conversations with you can mean so much to me—whether we’re joking, talking about random things, or just checking on each other.I also remember when we first met in the Roblox game. Before that, I almost never played, but now I often play together with you. I also remember the words you once sent me:“What makes it fun isn’t Roblox itself, but who we play it with.”If you ever feel tired of everything, you can talk to me. Maybe by sharing your feelings, your burden will feel a little lighter. Don’t hesitate to tell me, okay? I’m always here.That’s all I want to say. My message for you is: take care of your prayers, take care of your health, stay happy, and keep being enthusiastic about learning.
      </p>
