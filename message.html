      <h2>Mesage From Syfna</h2><h2>
      <p>
        Dear, Abi  <br>
        "First of all, I want to say thank you so much to you because honestly, with you being in my life this month, I've been happier than the previous months. I didn't expect to be friends with you this far, we were just strangers who met on Roblox. I'm so happy to know you, what makes me admire you is that you treat me well, different from others, that's what makes me comfortable with you. You even prioritize me, chatting with me in between your busy schedule, and you always agree to what I want hehe... Forgive me if I have many shortcomings, don't understand you or whatever, forgive me if during our chat there are words that offend you or are unpleasant to hear, forgive me if I always boss you around.With you,I also started to like playing Roblox hhe, even though before I rarely played it, like what I posted to you, the words "what's fun is not Roblox itself, but who we play it with". Even if our friendship ends someday, believe me, I'll always remember you... but I hope that doesn't happen to us, yahh... You know, I'm always overthinking, thinking about how when we're busy with our own lives, will we still be able to do things like this? Joking every night, playing games every night, and doing other things...If you're tired of everything, you can tell me, maybe by telling me, it can reduce your burden, don't hesitate to tell me, yaa, I'm always here.. The point is, my message is, stay healthy, stay happy, and keep being enthusiastic about learning and other things.
      </p>
